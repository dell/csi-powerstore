    # metroTopology is used in conjunction with "labels" to provide host based
    # registration for powerstore metro, where host nodes containing the provided
    # label will be registered as co-located local hosts, and nodes with the label
    # specified in the configuration for the metro replication target will be
    # registered as co-located remote hosts. All other nodes are registered as
    # co-located both hosts.
    #
    # *** Deprecated ***
    # Use hostConnectivity instead.
    # metroTopology is deprecated and remains only to support backward compatibility.
    #
    # Allowed Values: Uniform
    # Default Value: Uniform
    #
    # Example:
    # metroTopology: Uniform

    # label is used in conjunction with metroTopology to determine if the host
    # will be used to match the node label to decide the type of host registration,
    # Only one label should be specified.
    #
    # *** Deprecated ***
    # Use hostConnectivity instead.
    # Use of "labels" with "metroTopology" is deprecated and remains to support
    # backward compatibility.
    #
    # Optional: true
    # Allowed Values: a single key-value pair
    # Default Value: None
    #
    # Example:
    # labels:
    #   topology.kubernetes.io/zone: "zone-a"

    # hostConnectivity is used in conjunction with metro replication to configure
    # multipath optimization for a node's host entry in this PowerStore system.
    #
    # UNIFORM METRO
    #   Uniform metro is configured under the `metro` field.
    #   For each desired optimization (`metro.colocatedLocal`, `metro.colocatedRemote`,
    #   `metro.colocatedBoth`), provide a set of label expressions to describe a node
    #   whose host should be registered with this PowerStore, with the given multipath
    #   optimization.
    #
    #   If local, non-metro hosts are required alongside uniform metro hosts, under
    #   `hostConnectivity.local`, provide a set of label expressions to describe a node
    #   whose host should be registered with this PowerStore, without multipath optimization.
    #
    # NON-UNIFORM METRO
    #   Non-uniform host nodes should be registered as `local` and are configured
    #   under the `local` field. Non-uniform hosts in PowerStore do not require multipath
    #   optimization because the host nodes are only communicating with one side of the metro
    #   volume.
    #   To register a node as a non-uniform, metro host, under `hostConnectivity.local`,
    #   provide a set of label expressions to describe a node whose host should be
    #   registered with this PowerStore, without multipath optimization.
    #
    # matchExpressions follow the format outlined by Kubernetes when describing Node Affinity.
