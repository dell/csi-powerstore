# reclaimPolicy: PVs that are dynamically created by a StorageClass will have the reclaim policy specified here
# Allowed values:
#   Reclaim: retain the PV after PVC deletion
#   Delete: delete the PV after PVC deletion
# Optional: true
# Default value: Delete
reclaimPolicy: Delete

# volumeBindingMode controls when volume binding and dynamic provisioning should occur.
# Allowed values:
#   Immediate: indicates that volume binding and dynamic provisioning occurs once the
