# This test creates three different PersistentVolumeClaims using default
# ext4, xfs, and nfs storage classes and automatically mounts them to the pod.
#
# It assumes that you’ve created the same basic three storage classes from
# samples/storageclass folder without changing their names.
#
# To test the driver just run from root directory of repository
# > kubectl create -f ./tests/simple/
#
# You can find all resources in testpowerstore namespace.
# Check if pod is created and Ready and Running by running
# > kubectl get all -n testpowerstore
# (if it's in CrashLoopback state then driver installation wasn't successful, check logs of node and controller)
# After that can go into created container and check if everything is mounted correctly.
#
# After that you can uninstall the testing PVCs and StatefulSet
# > kubectl delete -f ./tests/simple/
